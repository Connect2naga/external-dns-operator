# ExternalDNS Operator

The ExternalDNS Operator deploys and manages [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), which dynamically manages
external DNS records in specific DNS Providers for specific Kubernetes resources.

This Operator is in the early stages of implementation. For the time being, please reference the
[ExternalDNS Operator OpenShift Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/786).
